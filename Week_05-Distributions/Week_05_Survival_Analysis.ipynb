        "Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until an event occurs, such as death in biological organisms or failure in mechanical systems. This topic is also called reliability theory or reliability analysis in engineering, duration analysis or duration modelling in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. Survival analysis attempts to answer certain questions, such as what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival?\n",
